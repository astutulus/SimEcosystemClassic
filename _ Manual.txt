Project Genesis and History
---------------------------

During M255 I conceived of a heirarchy of classes representing an ecosystem. 

Characteristics common to all living things (age, mass) were kept in an abstract superclass.

Characteristics of animals (food 

A plant might be a carnivore too, and some animals are carnivores AND herbivores, so these two would be interfaces.

My only means of displaying the living things was in textual form using a toString() method.

...until M257!

Now I have revisited and fleshed out my idea, with a nice GUI, and with a different thread for each animal.

I think you will enjoy running the resultant NetBeans project. 
Try placing a few areas of grass, several rabbits, then taking it off "pause" at the bottom.

Things disappear if:
- eaten
- age reaches maximum
- you use the "Smite" tool.

It's taken a long time -- but what more enjoyable form of revision?!
I hope to incorporate as much as I can of my studies, whichever way they lead.
