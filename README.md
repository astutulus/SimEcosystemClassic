# SimEcosystemClassic
Exercising knowledge from OU courses (M255, M257) that I was taking for personal interest, 2007-2008


### Main features
- Threading for each game entity
- AWT applet with *Swing* GUI components
- Classic inheritance, abstract classes and interfaces
- Mouse input; event listeners; exceptions


### Compilation in 2024
Old command line instructions no longer necessary as it runs straight from the IDE, including VS Code!
